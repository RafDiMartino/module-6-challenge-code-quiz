# JavaScript Quiz Game
## Description
In this assignement I had to create an app that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, all powered by JavaScript.

My task was to create a Coding Quiz about JavaScript

When you click the button "Start Quiz", the application presents a series of questions with multiple choice answers, the quiz is timed the countdown start at 60 seconds.

The acceptance criteria for this exercise were as follow:

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
- WHEN I click the start button
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- WHEN I answer a question
- THEN I am presented with another question
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
- THEN the game is over
- WHEN the game is over
- THEN I can save my initials and score

As an additional challenge I added a soud for correct and incorrect answer.

The application fully rensponsive for all the screen sizes.
